      <h1>Understand your audience</h1>
      <p>
        Before you start writing your blog post, make sure you have a clear
        understanding of your target audience. To do so, take the following
        steps
      </p>
      <h2>Ask yourself exploratory questions</h2>
      <p>
        To discover your audience, ask questions like: Who are they? Are they
        like me, or do I know someone like them? What do they want to know
        about? What will resonate with them?Jot down your notes in a notepad or
        a document
      </p>
      <p>
        . This is the time to brainstorm audience attributes from scratch, no
        matter how out of left field they may feel. You should also think about
        your audiences age, background, goals, and challenges at this stage
      </p>
      <h2>Carry out market research</h2>
      <p>
        Doing market research sounds like a big task, but in truth, it can be as
        simple as accessing a social media platform and browsing user and blog
        profiles that match with your potential audience.Use market research
        tools to begin uncovering more specific information about your audience
        â€” or to confirm a hunch or a piece of information you already knew. For
        instance, if you wanted to create a blog about work-from-home hacks, you
        can make the reasonable assumption that your audience will be mostly Gen
        Zers and Millennials. But its important to confirm this information
        through research
      </p>
      <h2>Create formal buyer personas</h2>
      <p>
        Once youve brainstormed and carried out market research, its time to
        create formal buyer personas. Its important because what you know about
        your buyer personas and their interests will inform the brainstorming
        process for blog posts
